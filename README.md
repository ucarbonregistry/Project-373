# Project-373
Delhi Metro, India

The metro transportation system is more efficient as compared to the traditional means of transport in the baseline, hence, the project activity achieves emission reductions through improved efficiency and calculated per passenger-kilometre. On average, metro system has lower GHG emissions per passenger-kilometre than those used in the absence of the project activity, hence, results in GHG emission reductions.

The objective of the large-scale project activity is to register 3 existing lines to a Delhi Metro
system operational in NCT of Delhi under phase 1 as UCR project activity. The existing lines
would provide new corridors which will be covering new geographical areas within the city.
The total length of Ph-I lines as part of project activity is 65.1 km.
The trains on these lines runs on broad gauge (1676 mm).

As the metro transportation system is more efficient compared to the traditional means of transport
in the baseline, the project activity achieves emission reductions through improved efficiency in
the transportation achieved and calculated per passenger-kilometre. On average, metro system has
lower GHG emissions per passenger-kilometre than those used in the absence of the project
activity, hence, results in GHG emission reductions.

General Description of the project activity:
The project Delhi Metro, India Phase 1 MRTS project is located in Delhi.
The details of the Delhi Metro Phase-I are as follows:

1. Line 1: Shahdara – Rithala
Network Length: 22 km

2. Line 2: Vishwavidyalaya - Central Secretariat
Network Length: 11 km

3. Line 3: Dwarka Sector 9 – Indraprastha
Network Length: 32.1 km

The baseline scenario is defined as the most likely scenario in the absence of the proposed project
activity. As per approved methodology, ACM0016, Version 04, “If the project activity is deemed to
be additional, then the baseline scenario is assumed to be the continuation of the use of current
modes of transport provided that the project participants can provide an explanation showing that
the existing transport system would be sufficient to meet the transportation demand that will be
met by the project system.

Baseline is determined as: Continuation of current public and individual transport system has
various advantages, as not being involved in considerable risks in technical and financial aspects
and does not attract large scale investments at within a short span, like metro project. According to
a report by Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, about 87 per cent passenger traffic is carried
by road. According to the same report, easy availability, adaptability2
 Outcome Budget 2012-13;
 
Ministry of Road Transport & Highways, Government of India to individual needs and the cost
savings are some of the factors which go in favour of road transport. The number of vehicles has
been growing at an average pace of around 10 per cent per annum. The share of road traffic in total
traffic has grown from 15.4 per cent of passenger traffic in 1950-51 to an estimated 90.2 per cent
of passenger traffic by the end of 2009-10. The rapid expansion and strengthening of the road
network, therefore, is imperative, to provide for both present and future traffic and for improved
accessibility to the hinterland. 

Thus, from the above description it is evident that the existing
transport system is the most plausible baseline scenario for the proposed project activity.
The continuation of current baseline transportation system indicates inefficient and emissions
intensive nature of the modes and hence, implementation of the current metro project activity
reduces the emissions from the baseline to the extent of passengers transported by project system.
